I mined a total of 0.24359921 Bitcoin (BTC) with the Raspberry Pi and Butterfly Labs 5 GH/s miner from December 17, 2013 - July 29, 2015.
<br><br>
Here’s a breakdown of costs:
<br>

* Total  -  $961
  * Hardware Components - $390
  * Electricity - $571

Total cost of power over that period of approximately 14,136 hours was calculated assuming $0.19 / kWh by taking the average over a one year period. The power consumption was approximated by recording usage with a [P3 Kill A Watt] over a ten day period and interpolating linearly.

Thanks to the technology behind Bitcoin, you can see the full contents of the wallet where mining profits were deposited on [BlockChain.info] @ [1BsWqHJh5kwLNHZzj6Q6DGaxRZVTK9U9A6] and a graph over time.

With the exchange rate of Bitcoins to USD at the time of writing this, the Return on Investment (ROI) with a balance of  0.24359921 BTC is about negative (-) $896. Breaking even would require the exchange rate to reach $3,844 USD / BTC; historically speaking the highest was around $1,100 in late 2013. Never say never though, here’s the current price from [CoinDesk].
