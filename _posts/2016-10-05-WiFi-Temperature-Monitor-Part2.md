Since writing the first WiFi temperature monitor post, I’ve implemented retrieving temperature values on a schedule, to generate a real-time dashboard. I came across this [Gadgets Apps Hacks Post], which utilizes [Google Apps Script’s] ability to connect to [External APIs] and record stock ticker values over time in [Google Sheets]. The method I used in the first part to write the temperature sensor value in a Sheet is more suited for a single import of a larger data set in JSON format. There is also a [tutorial from Particle] that uses [IFTTT] to log the data in a Sheet. Although the tutorial from Particle might be a little easier to implement, I chose to work solely with Google Apps Script; since I wanted to pull data from other APIs. I’ll use [WeatherUnderground] for the outside temperature and [Nest] for a comparison of inside temperature from another device.

For communication with my Nest Thermostat, I didn’t implement the [OAuth2.0] standard completely inside the Apps Script; although this would be possible using [apps-script-oauth2]. Following the [REST Quick Guide], I generated a [PIN for my Nest] and then used [Postman] to initiate the POST call for the Access Token to be used in the script.

Here are the results after a few days:

The [Google Sheet] is here (create a copy to view Script Editor and make changes) and I also posted the code as a [Gist here]. API keys, device ID’s etc. are all variables to be defined at the beginning of the Script.
